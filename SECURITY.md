Third-party stakeholders may include the reporter of the issue, affected direct or indirect users of Rask, and maintainers of upstream dependencies if applicable.

Downstream project maintainers and Rask users can request participation in coordination of applicable security issues by sending your contact email address, GitHub username(s) and any other relevant information to <insert email here>. Participation in the security issue coordination process is at the discretion of the Rask team.

## Security advisories

The Rask team announces security issues via [project GitHub Release notes](https://github.com/ryanseipp/rask/releases) and the [RustSec advisory database](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db) (i.e. `cargo-audit`).
